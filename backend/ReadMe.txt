Of course. A professional `README.md` is the front door to your project and is essential for a portfolio piece.

Based on everything we have built and finalized, here is a comprehensive `README.md` file for the project. You can create a file named `README.md` in the root of your `TES/` repository and paste this content directly into it.

# Thought Experiment Simulator (TES) - Backend

This repository contains the backend service for the Thought Experiment Simulator (TES), a cognitive tool designed to explore complex hypothetical scenarios. The application leverages a local Large Language Model (LLM) to orchestrate a sophisticated, multi-agent reasoning process, simulating a structured debate between different AI personas to provide a nuanced analysis of a user's query.

This project was developed as a professional portfolio piece and as an exploration into advanced human-AI collaboration for complex problem-solving.

## Core Features

  * **Multi-Persona AI Reasoning:** Utilizes a prompt-driven system to generate distinct viewpoints from three expert AI personas: The Visionary Optimist, the Critical Risk Analyst, and the Pragmatic Engineer.
  * **Dynamic Internal Debate:** Features a full round-robin debate where each persona critiques and responds to the others, deepening the analysis and exposing hidden assumptions.
  * **Structured Synthesis:** Concludes with an impartial summary that identifies key insights, conflicts, and provides an actionable recommendation with stated trade-offs.
  * **Real-Time Streaming API:** Uses FastAPI's `StreamingResponse` to broadcast simulation events (`perspective_generated`, `debate_turn`, etc.) in real-time to the client using a newline-delimited JSON format.
  * **Modern Layered Architecture:** Built with a clean separation of concerns (API, CRUD, Services, Models) for robustness, testability, and maintainability.
  * **Asynchronous from the Ground Up:** Fully asynchronous using Python's `async`/`await` and `aiosqlite` for high-performance, non-blocking I/O.

## Tech Stack

  * **Framework:** FastAPI
  * **Database:** SQLite
  * **Async Driver:** aiosqlite
  * **ORM:** SQLModel
  * **LLM Engine:** Ollama
  * **Default Model:** gemma:2b

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the backend server running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.11+
  * Git
  * [Ollama Desktop](https://ollama.com/) installed and running.

Once Ollama is installed, you must pull the model that the application uses:

```bash
ollama pull gemma:2b
```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/thought-experiment-simulator.git
    cd thought-experiment-simulator/backend
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**

    **On Windows:**

    ```cmd
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Ensure Ollama is running:** Make sure the Ollama Desktop application is running in the background. You should see its icon in your system tray.

2.  **Start the FastAPI server:** From the `TES/backend/` directory, run the following command:

    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001
    ```

The server will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8001`.

### API Usage & Testing

Once the server is running, the best way to interact with the API is through the built-in interactive documentation.

1.  **Open the docs:** Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8001/docs` in your browser.

2.  **Follow the workflow:**

      * Use the `POST /api/experiments/` endpoint to create a new thought experiment.
      * Take the `id` from the response.
      * Use the `POST /api/experiments/{experiment_id}/run` endpoint with that `id` to run the simulation and see the real-time event stream.
      * Use the `GET /api/experiments/{experiment_id}` endpoint to retrieve the final, completed results.
